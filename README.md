# Superstore-Marketing-Campaign-Dataset
Third mini project
A superstore is planning for the year-end sale. They want to launch a new offer - gold membership, that gives a 20% discount on all purchases, for only 499 dollar (usually 999 dollar on other days). It will be valid only for existing customers and the campaign through phone calls is currently being planned for them. 

Objective: The superstore wants to make a predictive model to predict the probability of a customer who might purchase the offer and wants to identify the different factors which affect the customer's response.
